This is an example of a script to check and AGOL layer and specific information from it to specific people.

Specifically, the script is set to run on a schedule on a workstation/server. The script pulls the latest information from the AGOL layer and queries based on a specific field. Once the processing of the feature is complete, the field is updated to ensure it will not be processed again.

Please modify to fit your needs 
If you have updates or improvements, I'd love to integrate them.
